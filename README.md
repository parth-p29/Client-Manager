# Customer-Manager

Introduction
-------------------

Hello Everyone!

This is an easy to use Desktop GUI Application I developed from scratch to help a local T.V Servicing Business manage their customers. The project allows the business owner to track if their clients have paid their bill, what services they are using, and much more additional details such as location, payment etc. Overall, it makes it much eaiser to organize their clients and ensure business processes run smoothly. 

Requirements
---------------

- Make sure you have Python installed onto your computer (Python 2 and up)
- Make sure you have the Tkinter library downloaded

How I bulit it
--------------------

This project was developed using Python - implementing various design strategies such as OOP principles to create 'widgets' inside the app. The GUI was built using the Tkinter library, allowing the user to have an easy time traversing through the app. The data was stored using an Sqlite3 database to store details such as a client's name, the total amount of money made, whether they have paid or not, etc.

Overall, I have learned a lot through this project and was able to help out someone with my idea (bonus points!). I hope you enjoy checking it out!
